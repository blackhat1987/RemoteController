This is a library allowing remote control an app through network.
Particularly useful when you want to use your PC to remote control a mobile app.

The mobile app's display will be streamed to PC, and mouse clicks on PC will be
treated as touch controls in mobile app for example.

I created this library to support [Multiness](https://lehoangquyenblog.wordpress.com/published-games/74-2/)
Online Multiplayer feature.
